## 🔧 **STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION**

```

**Create `client/src/components/EnhancedWarehouseDashboardCard.jsx`**

### **STEP 3: Add Professional Management Interface**

  switch (action) {
    case 'create':
      setLocation('/warehouse?mode=create');
      break;
    case 'view':
      if (receiptId) {
        setLocation(`/warehouse?receipt=${receiptId}`);
      } else {
        setLocation('/warehouse');
      }
      break;
    case 'manage':
