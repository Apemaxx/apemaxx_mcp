Warehouse Management Frontend Integration Guide
🎯 Integration Overview
Your Supabase database has been successfully updated with all necessary components for warehouse management. Here's how to integrate the frontend components:
📊 Database Components Created
✅ Views:

warehouse_receipt_summary - Optimized view for listing receipts with status
Enhanced with attachment counts and derived status logic

✅ Tables:

warehouse_receipt_bookings - Links receipts to LCL/freight bookings
Additional columns added to existing warehouse_receipts table

✅ Functions:

get_warehouse_analytics(user_uuid) - Returns dashboard statistics
link_warehouse_receipt_to_booking() - Existing function for booking links

✅ Storage:

warehouse-receipts bucket configured with proper permissions
Public access enabled for document viewing

🔧 Frontend Integration Steps
Step 1: Add the Service File
Create src/lib/warehouseService.js with the provided adapted service code.
Step 2: Add the Component
Create src/components/WarehouseReceiptManager.jsx with the provided adapted component code.
Step 3: Update Your Dashboard
Replace your existing warehouse section in your main dashboard component:
jsx// In your existing dashboard component (e.g., App.jsx or Dashboard.jsx)
import WarehouseReceiptManager from './components/WarehouseReceiptManager';

// Replace your existing warehouse receipt card with:
<WarehouseReceiptManager userId={user?.id} />
Step 4: Add Required Dependencies
Ensure you have Lucide React icons installed:
bashnpm install lucide-react
Step 5: Verify Supabase Client
Make sure your existing src/lib/supabase.js exports the client as supabase:
jsx// src/lib/supabase.js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabaseUrl = 'your-project-url'
const supabaseKey = 'your-anon-key'

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey)

🔗 Database Schema Alignment
The components are specifically adapted to work with your existing database structure:
Field Mappings:

wr_number → Receipt Number display
total_weight_lb → Weight field (your DB uses lb not lbs)
warehouse_receipts → Main table (no schema changes needed)
warehouse_receipt_attachments → File management (existing structure)

Status Logic:
Status is derived from existing data:

received → Default for new receipts
processing → 1+ days old
stored → 7+ days old
ready_for_release → Notes contain "released"
delivered → Notes contain "delivered"

📱 Mobile Responsive
The component is fully responsive and works well on:

Desktop (full feature set)
Tablet (optimized layout)
Mobile (simplified interface)

🔐 Security & Permissions
✅ Row Level Security (RLS):

All warehouse queries filter by user_id
Users can only see their own receipts
File uploads are user-scoped

✅ Storage Security:

Users can only upload to their own folders
File access is controlled by authentication
Public URLs are secure and time-limited
